    "2. If you're somewhat familiar with the basics of Python, but want to dig a little deeper, check out the game.py file. This is where most of the game logic is kept, broken down into _functions_ that perform one task. Taken together, they comprise the game.\n",
    "3. If the words \"object-oriented programming\" look vaguely familiar, or you already know another programming language, take a peek at the pyokemans.py file. It contains the classes that undergird the game, and documents some useful tricks and potential pitfalls of working with classes in Python.\n",
    "4. If you are starting to feel like you made a huge mistake, no worries. Just play the game and occasionally nod knowingly as I'm talking. I don't mind."

    "Each pokemon has a type, and each pokemon knows some moves, which also have a type. Some moves are more effective against certain types of pokemon, and some are less.

    "OK But What Does All This Have To Do With Programming\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "I recently read an [article](http://pgbovine.net/two-cultures-of-computing.htm) by a comp-sci professor at the University of Rochester. He argues that one of the main stumbling blocks in introducing people who are already skilled computer users to programming was a 'cultural' difference between how users and programmers view software: in a nutshell, users view a piece of software as a tool, while programmers view a piece of software as the other partner in a conversation. In his view, this explains why so many programmers (myself included) prefer development environments that look like something from 1970. While I'm not sure I buy his thesis entirely (to call these two approaches to computing different cultures seems a little excessive), I think it's an interesting framework, and guided how I thought about this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is meant to force you into a conversation with your computer. To play the game is to program in Python. Each pokemon is a piece of Python code (called an _object_), and you interact with the game world (limited as it is) using the python interpreter directly. Beyond some protections against things that might break the game entirely, there's nothing stopping you from making your pokemon amazingly strong, or inventing a new move for your pokemon, or even inventing your own pokemon."
